# Hi! Im Suraj Ganesh
Starting out as a coordinator at Cardinal Health gave me the chance to learn the inner workings of healthcare logistics and supply chain management. I quickly discovered how vital it is to stay organized, communicate clearly, and solve problems under pressure, skills that have become the backbone of my career. 

By ensuring timely and efficient product delivery across healthcare facilities overseeing freight loading into allocated trailers and applying the Takt methodology in Excel to evaluate hospital pick volumes and workforce needs, I’ve built a reputation for keeping operations running smoothly and efficiently. That foundation has allowed me to thrive in my role at Cardinal Health, where I help healthcare providers access the critical products and services they need to deliver quality patient care.
