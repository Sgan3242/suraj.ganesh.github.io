# Hi! Im Suraj Ganesh
Starting out as a coordinator at Cardinal Health gave me the chance to learn the inner workings of healthcare logistics and supply chain management. I quickly discovered how vital it is to stay organized, communicate clearly, and solve problems under pressure, skills that have become the backbone of my career. 

By ensuring timely and efficient product delivery across healthcare facilities overseeing freight loading into allocated trailers and applying the Takt methodology in Excel to evaluate hospital pick volumes and workforce needs, I’ve built a reputation for keeping operations running smoothly and efficiently. That foundation has allowed me to thrive in my role at Cardinal Health, where I help healthcare providers access the critical products and services they need to deliver quality patient care.

I'm passionate about working with technology and continuously learning how new software tools operate. I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas are shared and built together, and I find great fulfillment in teaching others what I’ve learned.

Through daily work with computers and digital systems, I’ve gained a strong understanding of safety protocols and the importance of protecting data in professional settings. My current role is more than just a job  it’s a reflection of my passion for communication, teamwork, and growth.

When I first started as a coordinator, I was timid and unsure. But with the support of my supervisors, I broke through those early challenges and developed into a confident, capable professional. That journey has shaped how I approach every opportunity with curiosity, resilience, and a commitment to excellence.

My goals are to continue growing within Cardinal Health and expand into the networking side of the organization. The knowledge I’ve gained from my courses has had a significant impact on my career, and I’m ready to take the next step. I am committed to applying what I’ve learned, building new skills, and contributing to the success of my team while advancing professionally.
